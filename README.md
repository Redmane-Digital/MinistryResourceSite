  Ministry Resource Site
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **What is Ministry Resource Site?**
    Ministry Resource Site is a template project for quickly spinning up a customizeable resource website which houses Resources, Training (Courses), and Books with an associated shopping cart and checkout flow.

    This project was build for [Mannahouse Church](https://mannahouse.church) and is not to be used by for for any other ministry, company, etc.

2. **What techologies / tools are utilized?**
    The project uses Shopify APIs and SDK, Thinkific APIs, and Hygraph APIs to source data. The Shopify SDK provides cart and checkout functionality.

    Additionally, the project supports translation via the Google Translate API, as well as adding GTM tags for analytics.

3. **How do I create a Resource Site?**
    If permission is granted explicity and in writing from Redmane Digital, you can clone this template repo to a repo for your resource site.

    The first thing you'll need to do after is load up your terminal in your local repo directory and run: `yarn add`.

    NOTE: If you do not have Yarn installed, you will need to install it before running the command above.
